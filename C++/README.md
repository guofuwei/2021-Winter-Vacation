## cin&&getline()

* cin considers a space (whitespace, tabs, etc) as a terminating character, which means that it can only display a single word (even if you type many words)
* That's why, when working with strings, we often use the `getline()` function to read a line of text. It takes `cin` as the first parameter, and the string variable as second:

## class

* **Note:** By default, all members of a class are `private` if you don't specify an access specifier
